These courses are designed as an introduction to geospatial data, specific aspects of geospatial at the World Bank, and a portfolio of geospatial data science across the institution.\n\n\nOrganization\nThis geospatial masterclass is a collaboration across several World Bank departments. Spearheaded by the Geospatial Operations Support Team in support of the Data Academy, the course is supported by the Data Partnership, ITS GeoLab, DIME, and Innovation.\nSee the tabs above to explore the schedule, course catalog, and course resources.
